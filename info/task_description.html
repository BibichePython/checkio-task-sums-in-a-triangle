    Consider a list of lists in which the first list has one integer and each consecutive list has one more integer then
    the last. Such a list of lists would look like a triangle. You must write a program that will help Nikola and
    Stephen look for a route down the pyramid by stepping down and to the left or to the right. Your goal is to make
    sure this program will find the sturdiest route, that is, the route with the highest possible sum on its way down
    the pyramid.

    <strong>Tip:</strong> Think of each step down to the left as moving to the
    same index location or to the right as one index location higher.

    <strong>How it is used: </strong>
    This is a classical problem, which shows you how to use dynamic programming.

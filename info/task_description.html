    <p>The musical notes shine as a melody begins to drift through the air. Harmonies intertwine and come to a
        crescendo. With the final note resonating through the air, a circular hole opens up in the center of the chamber
        floor. Sofia, Nikola and Stephen peer over the edge and see the top of an underground Pyramid.</p>

    <p>“Well isn’t that something.” Breathed Nikola.</p>

    <p>“It looks ancient. Maybe so prehistoric civilization constructed it?” Stephen pondered.</p>

    <p>“Why would they make a Pyramid underground though?”</p>

    <p>”That’s what we’re gonna find out!” Sofia exclaimed giddily and dropped through the hole and onto the cap of the
        Pyramid. Nikola and Stephen drop down after her as she begins to make her way down. “Oh, WOAH!” Sofia slips as a
        pile of rubble crumbles beneath her footing.</p>

    <p>“I gotcha!” Stephen extends his arms out and snatches her out of thin air, saving her from a long fall to the
        bottom.</p>

    <p>“We’re going to have to be careful climbing down.” Nikola said once the dust settled. “Let’s try and take this
        one step at a time and try to find the sturdiest route down.”</p>

    <p>“Okay, maybe you can lead the way then. I’d rather not fall all the way down.” Sofia shivered nervously recalling
        her slip. </p>

    Consider a list of lists in which the first list has one integer and each consecutive list has one more integer then
    the last. Such a list of lists would look like a triangle. You must write a program that will help Nikola and
    Stephen look for a route down the pyramid by stepping down and to the left or to the right. Your goal is to make
    sure this program will find the sturdiest route, that is, the route with the highest possible sum on its way down
    the pyramid.

<p>
    <strong>Tip:</strong> Think of each step down to the left as moving to the
    same index location or to the right as one index location higher.

    This is a classical problem, which show you how to use dynamical programming.

    For future journeys and treasures RoboTrio should train. Stephan built special flat model of a pyramid.
    And now robots can train speed gold running.
    They start at the top, collect gold on each room, choose left or right path and down to the next level.
    But Stephan need to know the maximum gold that can be collected for the one run.

    Consider a tuple of tuples in which the first tuple has one integer and
    each consecutive tuple has one more integer then the last.
    Such a list of lists would look like a triangle.
    You should write a program that will help Nikola find the highest possible sum on the sturdiest route down the pyramid.
    A routes down the pyramid by stepping down and to the left or to the right.

</p>
<p>
    <strong>Hints:</strong> Think of each step down to the left as moving to the
    same index location or to the right as one index location higher.
    And be careful if you want to use recursion here.

    <strong>How it is used: </strong>
    This is a classical problem, which shows you how to use dynamic programming.
    This concept is using for many optimisation tasks.
